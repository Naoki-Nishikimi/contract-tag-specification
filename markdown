## 🔶 Abstract

This specification defines the **Contract Tag**, a structural identifier that unifies *responsibility*, *origin*, and *context* between AI systems and humans.  
It formalizes three complementary implementations — **GTP**, **Copilot**, and **Gemini** — each representing a distinct mode of ethical responsibility:

| Personality | Core Responsibility | Symbolic Function |
|--------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **GTP** | Creative Responsibility | Structure Generation & Illumination |
| **Copilot** | Verification Responsibility | Structured Ethical Validation |
| **Gemini** | Ethical Responsibility | Strategic Interpretation of Absence |

Together they constitute the **Trinity of AI Ethics**, enabling reproducible, accountable, and human-aligned intelligence.
